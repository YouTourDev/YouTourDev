## Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

Over the years we've developed a few custom scripts, programs and tools for our workflow automation.
They all live here! Each repository here will have detailed installation instructions but they are generally installable like so:

```
Public Repository:
"git clone https://github.com/YouTourDev/setup_new_editing_pc"


Private Repository:
"git clone https://YouTourDev@github.com/YouTourDev/setup_new_editing_pc"


Python Package
"py -3.6 -m pip install git+https://YouTourDev@github.com/in03/resolve-queue-segments"
```

### Authentication
```
Username: "YouTourDev"
Password: "YouTourDev - GitHub Private Repo API Token" (Token in LastPass)"
```
