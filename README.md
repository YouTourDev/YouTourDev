## Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

Over the years we've developed a few custom scripts, programs and tools for our workflow automation.
They all live here! Each repository here will have detailed installation instructions but they are generally installable like so:

```
Public Repository:
"git clone https://github.com/YouTourDev/setup_new_editing_pc"


Private Repository:
"git clone https://YouTourDev@github.com/YouTourDev/setup_new_editing_pc"


Python Package
"pipx install git+https://YouTourDev@github.com/in03/resolve-queue-segments"
```

### Authentication

```
Username: "YouTourDev"
Password: "YouTourDev - GitHub Private Repo API Token" (Search in LastPass)
```
The access token expires every 90 days, so you will need to create another and add it to LastPass again if it has expired. Make sure you're logged in to YouTourDev, then manage account tokens here if necessary:  https://github.com/settings/tokens
